# Instacart Analysis - Python Project
Python project from Career Foundry's Data Analytics program
## Objective
In this assignment, I play the role of a data analyst for Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Although Instacart already has good sales, they wish to uncover more information about their sales patterns. As their analyst, I'm tasked to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis on some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the criteria they have provided.

# Data Source
Career Foundry provided the customers data set.
